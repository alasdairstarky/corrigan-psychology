    <p>We ask our new clients to complete an intake form to gather information such as emergency

        Corrigan Psychology Ltd is registered with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) and
        follows a set of guidelines around the protection of data and privacy from the professional
        regulator, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).
    </p>
    <h1>How long will we store data for?</h1>
    <p>Data will only be stored for the minimum period that it is required.</p>
    <p>Personal contact information, used to allow contact for therapy will be deleted within six months
        of the last therapeutic contact.</p>
    <p>It is advised by both the British Psychological Society (BPS) and the Health and Care
        Professions Council (HCPC) that therapeutic notes are stored for a seven year period. Case
        notes will be deleted every April for cases which have reached the end of this storage period</p>
    <h1 id="dataSharing">Who might data be shared with and why?</h1>
    <p>The information and data outlined above is treated as confidential and maintained in
        accordance with the codes of conduct and legal requirements of the Clinical Psychology
        profession. We will not share your information with anyone without your consent EXCEPT in the
        following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the information concerns risk of harm to you, another adult or a child.</li>
        <li>When disclosure is in the public interest to prevent a miscarriage of justice or where
            there is a legal duty, e.g. a Court Order.</li>
        <li>When there is need-to-know information for another health provider, such as your GP</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the exceptional circumstance where we may be considering breaching confidentiality, we
        would always aim to discuss this with you first. However, if we believed the danger to be
        imminent or that the disclosure would increase risk to you, another adult or a child then we may
        not be able to do so. Where possible, we will let you know that we are planning to contact your
        named emergency contact or your GP and will only share information relevant to the immediate
        emergency.</p>
    <p>If concerns arise about a disclosure relating to acts of terrorism, vulnerable adult or child
        protection issues or drug trafficking, confidentiality will be breached, and such disclosures will be
        passed onto the relevant authority without delay. Due consideration should be exercised before
        disclosing anything of a previously unreported criminal nature, as we are legally bound to
        contact relevant authorities.</p>
    <p>Registered Clinical Psychologists receive regular Clinical Supervision from another therapist.
        This is an opportunity for us to discuss our work and ensure we are practicing safely and
        effectively. Within Clinical Supervision sessions therapeutic work is discussed. However, your
        identity will not be disclosed. Clinical Supervision is treated as a confidential space.</p>
    <p>Corrigan Psychology Ltd accesses services provided by an accountant. They are fully insured
        professionals and only have access to the data required to complete their business tasks. They
        work in accordance with the GDPR guidelines and are registered with ICO.</p>
    <h1>Accessing your information</h1>
    <p>You have the right to request access to your records. You can make a data request and we will
        usually share this within a 30 day period. There may be an admin fee for accessing this
        information and we may need to request further evidence to verify your identity.</p>
    <p>You have the right to get your information corrected if it is inaccurate, however as records are to
        be retained for seven years, we reserve the right to refuse a request to delete therapy records,
        where to do so would be in contradiction to professional guidelines.</p>
    <p>
        We take no responsibility for notes that you choose to take during our sessions, how you decide
        to store them or who you share information regarding the content of our sessions with.
