						<h2>Corrigan Psychology Ltd</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Hello, and welcome. I’m Fiona, a Clinical Psychologist with 17 years of experience working in
						mental health services. Since qualifying I’ve worked across a range of NHS settings as well as
						in New Zealand’s public health system. My main focus has been working with adults in community
						mental health but my experience spans many areas including physical health, dementia, urgent
						care, and forensic services. Most recently, I’ve been working as a Senior Principal Clinical
						Psychologist in adult mental health within the NHS.</p>
					<h3>Qualifications</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy)</b> – University of Glasgow (2012–2015)</li>
						<li><b>BA (Hons) Psychology</b> – University of Strathclyde (2006–2010)</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Registration</h3>
					<p>I am registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a Clinical
						Psychologist.</p>
					<h3>Who I Work With</h3>
					<p>I have a special interest in working with people who have experienced trauma and are living with
						the ongoing effects of it. I also offer support for a range of other difficulties, including:
					</p>
					<uL>
						<li>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD</li>
						<li>Anxiety (panic, worry, phobias, OCD)</li>
						<li>Low self-esteem and self-criticism</li>
						<li>Depression and low mood</li>
						<li>Relationship and interpersonal issues</li>
						<li>Emotion regulation difficulties</li>
						<li>Perfectionism</li>
						<li>Health-related emotional challenges</li>
						<li>Psychosis</li>
						<li>Grief and loss</li>
						<li>Perinatal mental health concerns</li>
					</uL>
					<h3>How I Work</h3>
					<p>As a Clinical Psychologist, I’m trained in a number of evidence-based therapies. This means I
						will tailor our work together to suit your goals, preferences, and what feels most helpful to
						you. You don’t need to know exactly what kind of therapy you need, we’ll figure that out
						together.</p>
					<p>I’m committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive space for all clients. I recognise that
						factors like race, gender, disability, sexuality, neurodiversity, and culture can interact with
						our mental health. My practice is affirming, trauma-informed, and respectful of your identity
						and lived experience. Whether you’re new to therapy or returning after some time, my goal is to
						offer a calm, safe and respectful space where you can feel heard and supported.</p>
					<p>Therapy can be hard work as it may involve looking at things you’ve avoided or changing patterns
						that feel familiar. I’ll guide and support you through that process at your pace. My role is to
						help you explore what’s going on, understand yourself better, and to feel empowered to make
						meaningful change. </p>

						<h2>Psychological Therapy</h2>
					</header>
					<h3>What to Expect from Therapy</h3>
					<p>In the first session, we’ll focus on understanding what’s brought you to therapy and what you’d
						like to get out of it. There’s no pressure to explain things perfectly or get everything “right”
						and I understand that often people will feel nervous about starting therapy. My role is to
						listen, understand, and support you. From there, I’ll draw on the approaches below to shape a
						personalised plan that feels right for you. We will work together to find the approach that
						feels most helpful for you, whether that’s focusing on understanding past experiences, building
						new coping strategies, or both.</p>
					<p>Sessions are 50 minutes long and held online. I offer both short-term and longer-term
						therapy depending on your needs.</p>
					<p>Fees: 50 minute session &#163;120</p>
					<p>Informal discussions to answer any questions about my services and how I might be able to help
						prior to booking an appointment are not charged for. Brief telephone contact or emails regarding
						future sessions are not charged for.</p>
					<p>Appointments are payable by BACS. I will provide my bank details at the time of booking your
						first session.</p>
					</ul>
					<h3>Therapies I Offer</h3>
					<h4>Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT)</h4>
					<p>CFT is designed to help people who struggle with shame, guilt, or harsh self-criticism. It helps
						build inner safety and self-compassion, using an understanding of how our brains respond to
						threat and how we can soothe ourselves more effectively.</p>
					<h4>Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR)</h4>
					<p>EMDR helps you process distressing or traumatic memories. It supports the brain’s natural healing
						process and can reduce the emotional intensity of past experiences.</p>
					<h4>Chairwork</h4>
					<p>Chairwork is creative and active, using techniques like role play and guided dialogue to help you
						explore different parts of yourself, past experiences, or inner conflicts. It can be a powerful
						way to gain clarity, process emotions, shift perspective and strengthen self-compassion. I often
						use chairwork within CFT and trauma-focused approaches.</p>
					<h4>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</h4>
					<p>CBT looks at how your thoughts, feelings, and actions are linked. It helps you recognise
						unhelpful patterns and learn more helpful ways of thinking and coping. It’s a structured therapy
						that works well for issues like anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
					<h4>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</h4>
					<p>CPT is a specific form of CBT for people who have experienced trauma. It helps you understand how
						trauma may have affected your beliefs about yourself, others, and the world. We work together to
						explore and move past “stuck points” and reduce distress.</p>
					<h4>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h4>
					<p>ACT focuses on helping you move toward the things that matter to you, even when life feels
						difficult. It teaches skills to manage distressing thoughts and feelings without getting
						overwhelmed by them.</p>
					<h4>Schema Therapy</h4>
					<p>Schema therapy explores long-standing patterns, or “schemas”, that may have developed early in
						life and still affect you today. This approach can help if you often feel stuck in the same
						emotional cycles or relationship patterns.</p>
					<h4>Mindfulness and Emotion Regulation Skills</h4>
					<p>I also integrate practical tools into therapy that help you manage strong emotions, stay
						grounded, and build awareness of your internal experiences in the moment. These can be
						especially helpful during periods of distress or overwhelm or as part of longer-term work.</p>

						<h2>Clinical Supervision</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I offer clinical supervision to psychologists and other mental health professionals.</p>
					<p>Since 2016 I’ve supervised clinicians at various stages of their careers from trainees to
						qualified practitioners across different specialties. My approach to supervision is
						collaborative, reflective, and grounded in psychological theory. I aim to provide a supportive
						space where you can explore clinical work, develop your skills, reflect on your practice, and
						feel resourced in your role.
						Supervision can include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Case discussion and formulation</li>
						<li>Integrating different therapy models (CBT, CFT, EMDR, Chairwork, ACT, etc.)</li>
						<li>Working with trauma and complexity</li>
						<li>Developing confidence, boundaries, and professional identity</li>
						<li>Exploring the emotional impact of clinical work</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I offer online supervision to UK-based professionals. Sessions can be arranged on a
						regular or ad hoc basis, depending on your needs.</p>
					<p>If you’re interested in supervision or would like to have a conversation to see if we’re a good
						fit, feel free to get in touch.</p>
					<p>Fees: 60 minute session &#163;110</p>

						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					</header>
					<h4>What days and times do you offer sessions?</h4>
					<p>I offer therapy and supervision sessions on weekday afternoons and evenings — typically from
						2:30pm onwards, Monday to Friday. I may have flexibility outside of these times, so feel free to
						get in touch if you’d like to enquire about availability.</p>
					<h4>How much do you charge?</h4>
					<p>My standard fee is &#163;120 per 50-minute session for individual therapy, and &#163;110 for
						clinical
						supervision.</p>
					<h4>Do you accept health insurance?</h4>
					<p>I am currently registered with AVIVA, AXA, BUPA and WPA. I have pending recognitions with other
						providers.</p>
					<h4>How often do I need to see you?</h4>
					<p>Appointments are flexible and can be more or less frequent depending on your needs. Typically I
						would recommend weekly sessions. Some people prefer fortnightly and in the case of trauma
						processing work, in some cases it can be helpful to have twice weekly or 90 minute sessions
						(charged at &#163;215).</p>
					<h4>How long will therapy take?</h4>
					<p>This varies from person to person. Some people benefit from a few sessions focused on a specific
						issue, while others prefer longer-term therapy to explore deeper patterns. We’ll discuss this
						together and review progress regularly.</p>
					<h4>What if I need to cancel my appointment?</h4>
					<p>I understand that unexpected events, such as illness, might result in you having to cancel your
						appointment at short notice. Should you need to cancel or reschedule, please let me know by
						email as soon as possible. Cancellations or rescheduling with more than 48 hours' notice (Monday
						to Friday, during working hours) will not incur any charge. If you fail to give less than 48
						hours' notice (Monday to Friday, during working hours), you will be charged for the session.
						However, where possible, I will do my best to offer an alternative time. Please note that
						rescheduling under these circumstances is at the psychologist's discretion. </p>
					<h4>How do I know if therapy is right for me?</h4>
					<p>Therapy can be helpful if you’re feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or would like support to understand
						yourself better and make meaningful changes. It’s okay if you’re unsure — the first session is a
						chance to explore whether it feels like a good fit.</p>
					<h4>What is a Clinical Psychologist?</h4>
					<p>In the UK, a Clinical Psychologist is a practitioner psychologist who has completed a Doctorate
						in Clinical Psychology. This includes extensive training in assessment, formulation, and
						delivering a range of psychological therapies. Clinical Psychologists are trained to work with
						people experiencing a wide range of emotional, psychological, and mental health difficulties.
						They do not prescribe medication but work in depth using evidence-based therapeutic approaches.
						All Clinical Psychologists must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council
						(HCPC).</p>
					<h4>Do I need a diagnosis to come to therapy?</h4>
					<p>No. You do not need a formal diagnosis to access therapy. Many people come to therapy simply
						because they’re struggling, feeling stuck, or want support with specific issues or patterns.</p>
					<h4>What’s the difference between a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and a counsellor?</h4>
					<p>A Clinical Psychologist is trained to provide psychological assessment and therapy, and does not
						prescribe medication.
						A Psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can diagnose mental health conditions and prescribe
						medication.
						A Counsellor or Psychotherapist may have different levels of training and often focuses on
						supportive talking therapy. All roles can be valuable, but differ in training and focus.</p>
					<h4>Is everything I say in therapy confidential?</h4>
					<p>Yes, confidentiality is a key part of therapy. There are some legal and ethical limits, such as
						if there is a risk of serious harm to you or others. I’ll explain this fully in our first
						session.</p>
					<h4>What if I find therapy difficult?</h4>
					<p>Therapy can feel challenging at times — especially when exploring painful or complex issues — but
						that’s often when the most meaningful changes begin. I’ll support you through the process at a
						pace that feels manageable.</p>
