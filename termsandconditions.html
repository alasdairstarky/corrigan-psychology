    <h1>Corrigan Psychology Ltd - Therapy Agreement</h1>
    <h1>Terms and Conditions of Therapy Agreement for Online Therapy</h1>
    <h2>Basic Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>The present therapy agreement outlines the Terms and Conditions for services provided to
        Clients by Corrigan Psychology Ltd, including Clients seen directly by Dr Fiona Corrigan. The
        present therapeutic agreement abides by the GDPR legislation 2018. By commencing therapy,
        you (the Client) agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
    <p><b>All new Clients are required to read and confirm the acceptance of the terms and
            conditions of this therapy agreement.</b></p>
    <p>Confirmation can be provided in writing via email. Ifwritten confirmation is not provided for any reason, then by
        starting therapy (online) the Client
        agrees to the terms & conditions of this agreement. The Client is required to respond in writing
        (via email) if he/she/they do not agree to the terms and conditions of this agreement.</p>
    <h3>Crisis</h3>
    <p>Corrigan Psychology Ltd is not able to provide crisis mental health support. Clients who are
        suicidal or in crisis, or who require urgent attention in relation to their mental health are advised
        to contact their GP surgery, NHS 24 (111), 999 or local emergency services. If your GP surgery
        is closed, NHS 24 is available to give help and advice or the Samaritans (116 123) provide
        twenty-four hour support to people who are in crisis or suicidal.</p>
    <h3>Cancellation, Non-attendance & Late attendance</h3>
    <p>Any self-funded or private healthcare provider funded session cancelled or rescheduled by
        the Client with less than forty-eight hours' notice will be charged in full to the Client. Sessions
        missed without notice of cancellation are charged in full. Sessions unable to proceed due to
        technical issues on the Client’s part are charged in full. Clients logging in part-way through
        their allotted time will be seen to the end of the allotted time only, and the full session fee will
        apply. All appointments for uninsured Clients (self-funding) must be paid at the time of booking
        the appointment or at least twenty-four hours before the appointment. Failure to do so will
        result in the Client forfeiting the session.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, technical challenges can affect any service and would typically be beyond the
        Psychologist’s control. Connection issues causing significant disruption to a session would
        be continued instead by telephone.</p>
    <h3>Payment</h3>
    <p>If self-funding, payment can be made by bank transfer and is due at least twenty-four hours
        prior to the appointment. Bank transfers are payable to Corrigan Psychology Ltd, Account
        Number: 46412254, Sort Code: 04-03-33. Please use your last name and date of the
        appointment as the reference, so that the payment can be easily identified. A payment invoice
        will be sent to the e-mail address provided by the Client. The Psychologist reserves the right
        not to proceed with the session if full payment has not been received.</p>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Corrigan Psychology Ltd abides by the code of confidentiality of HCPC and GDPR regulations.
        Identifying information, such as Client’s name, address, biographical details and other
        description of a Client’s life and his/her circumstances, will be kept private and stored digitally
        on an encrypted system.</p>
    <p>Any information noted on paper as part of clinical notes during sessions will be transferred
        onto an encrypted system, and hard copies will be shredded. Client information will continue
        to be stored securely for seven years after therapy comes to an end. The Client may request
        to access their personal information at any time.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Confidentiality and Records</h3>
    <p>The full Privacy Policy for Corrigan Psychology Ltd can be viewed at
        <a href="https://corriganpsychology.co.uk/privacypolicy"
            target="_blank">corriganpsychology.co.uk/privacypolicy</a>. The privacy of Clients accessing
        services is
        protected from the point of initial enquiry to the end of therapy, and afterwards. What is
        discussed in therapy is confidential between Client and Psychologist. Brief session notes are
        kept and stored securely. If it is assessed that a Client is at risk of harming themselves, or a
        disclosure is made that leads the Psychologist to think that someone else is at risk of coming
        to harm, then information will be shared with the relevant agencies. Sometimes it is useful or
        necessary for the Psychologist to be in touch with a Client’s GP. The Psychologist may discuss
        contacting the Client’s GP with the Client, depending on what arises in assessment and
        therapy. Psychologists receive clinical supervision where cases are discussed to ensure
        quality and safe practice. Client identity is protected in supervision. Supervision is bound by a
        confidentiality agreement.
    </p>
    <h3>Session Conduct</h3>
    <p>Appropriate modes of dress are required, as if you were attending the appointment in person.
        The Psychologist reserves the right to terminate a session or withdraw from the provision of
        treatment in cases where the Psychologist considers behaviour or attire to be inappropriate;
        or the Client engages in abusive, threatening, or harassing behaviour; or presents under the
        influence of alcohol or non-prescribed drugs. Such conduct may also result in permanent
        discontinuation of the therapeutic relationship. This policy ensures the safety and well-being
        of both parties and upholds the standards of ethical practice. Recording of video sessions is
        not permitted without prior agreement in writing with the Psychologist.</p>

                    we may suspend your therapy sessions until you have paid us the outstanding
                    amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending your therapy sessions.</li>
                <li>It is at the Psychologist’s discretion whether to accept late payment.</li>
                <li>The Client must be current with payments before booking a new session.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cancellations</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 you have a cancellation period of
                    14 days in which you can change your mind (this is known as the <b>cooling off
                        period).</b> You have 14 days after the day we email you to confirm we accept your
                    order in which to cancel the contract. However, once we have completed the
                    Services you cannot change your mind, even if the period is still running. If you
                    cancel after we have started the Services, you must pay us for the Services provided
                    up until the time you tell us that you have changed your mind. This means that if you
                    request that the therapy starts during the cancellation period you can still cancel
                    within the 14 day period but you will have to pay us for the therapy sessions which
                    have taken place.</li>
                <li>To ensure our high standards in our treatment for our Clients, we recommend that
                    therapy sessions occur on a regular basis. We will agree their frequency with you
                    and we ask you to commit to this. Since we lose money if an appointment is
                    cancelled at short notice if, after the cooling off period has expired, you wish to
                    cancel an appointment you must give us at least 48 working hours’ notice (for
                    example, if you wish to cancel an appointment on a Monday you must notify us on
                    Thursday of the previous week). Cancellations of appointments made with less than
                    48 working hours’ notice will result in a cancellation fee equal to the cost of the
                    missed session (<b>Cancellation Fee</b>). If you fail to attend a therapy session without
                    notice you will be charged the Cancellation Fee.</li>
                <li>If your health insurance company is providing funding, you must check your policy to
                    ascertain how cancellations are handled. If your insurance company requires you to
                    pay personally for cancelled sessions or sessions which you fail to attend without
                    notice you will be personally responsible for paying the Cancellation Fee in
                    accordance with clause 7.2.</li>
                <li>No refund will be given for any late arrival at the session under any circumstances.
                    This includes emergency or unforeseen circumstances out of the Client’s immediate
                    control, as the forty-eight-hour cancellation policy will still apply. If the Client arrives
                    late, an extension of the agreed time or rescheduling the session will not be offered.</li>
                <li>The Psychologist reserves the right to terminate treatment due to repeated non-
                    attendance or late cancellations by the Client.</li>

        <li><b>Online therapy sessions</b>
            <ol>

                    and you agree to promptly notify us of any changes to your contact details.</li>
                <li>When you have a verified booking for an appointment for a therapy session, you will
                    receive an email within 48 hours (working days). In this email you will receive
                    confirmation of your booking on the agreed day and time. Prior to your first
                    appointment you will receive an email from Clinix (<a
                        href="mailto:hello@emails.clinix.digital">hello@emails.clinix.digital</a>) with a
                    personal link to register your email address and to log in by creating a password.
                    You will receive an invitation from Clinix for all appointment bookings and will be
                    asked to confirm your attendance. You can attend sessions by logging in to the Clinix
                    website (<a href="https://clients.clinix.digital" target="_blank">clients.clinix.digital</a>) using
                    your email and
                    password. You are
                    responsible for saving your login details, appointment email and link. If you have not
                    received an email about the confirmation within 48 hours (working days) please
                    check your junk mail/spam folder. If you are unable to find the link in your junk
                    mail/spam folder then please contact us.</li>
                <li>In order to use Clinix properly, you must have the necessary hardware, software and
                    reliable internet access. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary
                    for you to have; (i) used your personal registration link to complete registration and
                    have access to Clinix; and (ii) ensuring your internet connection will allow you to
                    access Clinix and is sufficiently reliable for the duration of the session. We will not be
                    responsible for delays in commencing sessions or interruptions to sessions caused
                    by problems with Clinix. We will not extend a therapy session due to problems with
                    your internet connection or hardware which affect your ability to connect to Clinix.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for being on time to your therapy session. We recommend that
                    you are connected to Clinix via the link you received in your confirmation email and
                    have checked the image and sound at least 5-10 minutes before the session is due
                    to commence. We will not extend a therapy session if you are late joining the
                    session.</li>
                <li>At times the session may be interrupted by technical glitches which are beyond the
                    control of either you or us. If the session drops out the clinical Psychologist will try to
                    reconnect the session for the next 10 minutes. If they are unable to do so due to
                    technical glitches the session will continue by telephone.</li>
                <li>The Psychologist will not terminate the session before the agreed time. However, if
                    the Client desires to finish a session earlier than the agreed time, a refund for the
                    remaining time of the session will not be given.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Email and Telephone Policy</b>
            <ol>
                <li>If necessary, your clinical Psychologist can receive email communication in the form
                    of confidential reports and letters, and/or additional information. Your clinical
                    Psychologist may also make or receive telephone calls related to your therapy or
                    speak to you on the telephone. Email or telephone communication for the purpose of
                    arranging appointments is an exception to this clause.</li>
                <li>Such additional work as is set out in clause 10.1 shall incur an additional fee. Such
                    fees will be calculated as the hourly fee charged for your therapy (<b>Hourly Fee</b>)
                    multiplied by the time spent. These additional charges must be paid by you or your
                    insurance provider. We will invoice these fees to you. Invoices must be paid in
                    accordance with clause 7.2 above.</li>
                <li>Your clinical Psychologist cannot guarantee rapid responses to email communication
                    due to the high volume of emails that your Psychologist receives.</li>
                <li>It is important to be aware that communications of a clinical nature and especially
                    clinical decision-making will not be encouraged or engaged in by your clinical
                    Psychologist via email and telephone. In our experience clinical conversations are
                    best communicated face-to-face during your scheduled online appointment.</li>

        <li><b>Prior to your initial appointment</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Prior to your first appointment we will send you a link to an intake form to complete to
                    help us more fully understand the background to your current concerns. This is a
                    detailed document about your situation or that of your family and we ask that it is
                    completed prior to your first appointment. The data collected from this will be stored
                    electronically, compliant with GDPR.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Anti-Discrimination Policy</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Your clinical Psychologist respects difference and diversity. Differences include
                    sexuality, sexual preference or orientation, religion, political beliefs, ethnicity,
                    disability, gender expression or age.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Health and Safety</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Your clinical Psychologist will take the utmost care and due diligence when working
                    with you as a Client and will adhere to all the health and safety regulations within the
                    framework appropriate for online therapy.</li>

        </li>
        <li><b>Complaints</b>
            <ol>
                <li>We hope you will never have to complain about the service provided by Corrigan
                    Psychology Ltd but if you do have a concern please put it in writing to your clinical
                    Psychologist, Dr Fiona Corrigan. Alternatively you can make a complaint via the
                    Health and Care Professions Council (website detailed in the beginning of this
                    document).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Right to Terminate Sessions or Treatment</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Corrigan Psychology Ltd is committed to providing a safe, respectful, and
                    professional environment for both clients and practitioners. To maintain this standard,
                    the psychologist reserves the right to terminate any session immediately and/or
                    withdraw from the provision of further psychological services under any of the
                    following circumstances: (i) The client displays abusive, harassing, threatening, or
                    discriminatory behaviour toward the psychologist or others; (ii) The client attends a
                    session while under the influence of alcohol or non-prescribed drugs; (iii) The client
                    engages in behaviour that significantly disrupts or undermines the therapeutic
                    process, or compromises the safety or integrity of the psychologist’s
                    practice. Subsequently, no refund or any monies will be given for the remaining time
                    of the booked session.</li>
                <li>Where appropriate and safe to do so, concerns will be discussed with the client in
                    advance of any decision to end treatment. However, in situations where there is an
                    immediate risk to safety or professional standards, sessions may be terminated
                    without prior notice.</li>
                <li>Corrigan Psychology Ltd reserves the right to decline or discontinue treatment if it is
                    deemed that the service is no longer appropriate for the client’s needs, or where
                    ethical or legal obligations prevent continuation. In such cases, referrals to alternative
                    services may be provided where possible.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Reviews and Ending Therapy</b>
            <ol>
                <li>The Client and the Psychologist will review sessions regularly depending on the
                    Client’s demand or as the Psychologist finds this appropriate.</li>
                <li>The Client is not tied into any long-term commitment and they may end sessions by
                    giving forty-eight hours notice in writing. Having an ending session, depending on the
                    length of treatment, is recommended.</li>
                <li>If the Psychologist considers the Client’s needs are beyond the limits of his/her
                    competence, the Psychologist reserves the right to terminate the therapeutic
                    contract. The Psychologist will discuss this with the Client in the session and further
                    recommendations, if possible, may be provided.</li>
                <li>The desired outcome as an achievement of the goal(s) cannot be guaranteed or
                    promised to the Client by the Psychologist. It would be unethical to provide a
                    guarantee for a Client’s treatment of therapy.</li>
                <li>If the Client is not satisfied with the therapy’s outcome, there is no refund.</li>
                <li>The Psychologist can only offer an estimate of the duration of therapy based on their
                    clinical experience. This, however, is only an estimate and therapy can be extended
                    or terminated based on the Client’s needs and treatment’s progress.</li>
                <li>Sometimes a Client requires more time or less time than expected and this can only
                    become known after therapy has started. If the Client is in any doubt at any point or
                    has any questions relating to the agreed duration of therapy, the Client must raise
                    the appropriate questions with the Client during an agreed therapy session.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Other important terms</b>
            <ol>
                <li>This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to
                    enforce any of its terms.</li>
                <li>Each of the clauses of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant
                    authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain
                    in full force and effect.</li>
                <li>If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under
                    these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this
                    contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not
                    prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a
                    payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the Services, we can
                    still require you to make the payment at a later date.</li>
                <li>These terms are governed by Scottish law and you can bring legal proceedings in
                    respect of the products in the Scottish courts. If you live in England or Wales you can
                    bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the
                    English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in
                    respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the Scottish courts.</li>
